# Senior Project: Pentago
Simulation of the board game Pentago, with hopes of eventually have a machine play and learn the game using reinforcement learning. 

Right now, it has a basic output. It is currently using Numpy. 

If you have pip:
    pip install numpy

TODO:
  Add rules to check for win for pentago. (DONE and UPLOADED)
  Add user interface and graphics using pygame or tkinter. 
  Animation for the rotation of each quadrant
