The game is composed of 2 states,

1. Put the piece
	in this state you just left click
	wherever you want to put the piece
2. Flip a square
	in this state, you left click to
	rotate the square counter-clockwise
	and you right click to turn the
	square clockwise. The square that
	is rotated is chosen based on where
	the mouse is based on the board. 

These 2 states come one after the other. 
Once you finish putting the piece, the 
Flip the square state will be active and
you have to choose which square you want
to rotate. These 2 states will then repeat
over and over again. I still haven't finished
implementing the winning conditions, I'll
be implementing them later today (wednsday)
